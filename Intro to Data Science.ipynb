I will be using a the titanic data set to go through different concepts and how to implement them on the titanic data set. There will be four other data sets provided alongside the Titanic data set for you to apply the strategies and concepts to. I would advise you to try and not move on to the next section until you can do all the practice problems without scrolling back up to the examples that are shown. If there are any errors, please let me know. Enjoy!</p>"
